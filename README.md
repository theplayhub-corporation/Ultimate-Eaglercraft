# Welcome to Ultimate Eaglercraft!
This is a website similar to Eaglercrack (if you know it) where you can find all things related to Eaglercraft!
There are currently 3 developers, and I am trying to update this as much as possible for it to be the best it can be.
I recommend looking through some of the features below!

## Features
- Find pre-built worlds to download and play!
- Search for servers to play with other people!
- Download resource packs to customize your Eaglercraft!
- Look at a <b>giant</b> selection of clients to play on!
- See our built-in Quick Guide made by Thundiverter!
- Download skins for your Eaglercraft character!
- We have 1.3, 1.5, and 1.8 clients for Eaglercraft!
- The best part? It's 100% <u>free!</u>
